A token is the unit of text for Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nOne of the first steps that ChatGPT does when processing any prompt is splitting the user input into tokens. And that is the job of the so-called _tokenizer_.\n\nKnowing how your prompt and completion will be processed in terms of tokens is useful because it can give you useful information like whether the string is too long for a text model to process, or how much an OpenAI API call will cost as usage is priced by token, among others.\n\n**Knowing how the tokenizer works can help you crafting your prompts accordingly.**","metadata":{},"id":"ddbdad4b-1237-4436-b67d-fe5f1a6d3563","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"review = \"\"\"\nThe children's computer I bought for my daughter is absolutely fantastic!

This control empowers developers to mitigate risks and uphold the integrity, safety, and ethical standards of their applications.\n\n📤 **Output model control** refers to the implementation of measures and methodologies that enable monitoring and filtering of the responses generated by the model in its interactions with users. By exercising control over the model’s outputs, developers can address potential issues such as biased or inappropriate responses.\n\nModels like ChatGPT can exhibit biases or inaccuracies, particularly when influenced by unfiltered user input during conversations. Without proper control measures, the model may inadvertently disseminate misleading or false information. Therefore, it is essential not only to moderate user input, but also to implement measures for moderating the model’s output.\n\nOpenAI provides a Moderation API for that purpose. Specifically, the moderation endpoint serves as a tool for checking content against OpenAI’s usage policies, which target inappropriate categories like hate speech, threats, harassment, self-harm (intent or instructions), sexual content (including minors), and violent content (including graphic details).\n\nLet's start using it to moderate our workflow!\n\nFor more details on the following example, run it along with the article [ChatGPT Moderation API: Input/Output Control](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/chatgpt-moderation-api-input-output-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt3-data-4754389ec9c8).","metadata":{},"id":"cbb757fe-bb0a-4640-8946-8a2a2efb66e0","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"user_input = \"\"\"\nMama always said life was like a box of chocolates.
