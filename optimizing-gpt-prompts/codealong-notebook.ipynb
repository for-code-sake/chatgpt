And believe it or not, you will start prompting better than most ChatGPT users following some basic good practices.\n\nA specific prompt doesn’t mean a short prompt.

Calculate the mean of each vector. The mean is the sum of all values in the vector divided by the number of values.\n\n2. Calculate the variance of each vector. Variance measures the spread of values in a vector. It is calculated by subtracting the mean from each value, squaring the result, summing all the squared values, and dividing by the number of values.\n\n3. Calculate the standard deviation of each vector. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of each value from the mean.\n\n4. Plot the dispersion chart. Use a graphing tool or software to create a scatter plot. Place the mean of each vector on the x-axis and the standard deviation on the y-axis. Plot a point for each vector, connecting them with a line if desired.\n\nThe dispersion chart will show the spread and central tendency of the two vectors. The distance of each point from the mean represents the variability of the values in that vector. The angle between the two vectors can also provide insights into their relationship.\n"}]},{"source":"As you can see in the example above, the GPT model gaves a really generic and vague answer to the given prompt, as the prompt was generic and vague too. \nWe have just stated that we want to know how to generate a dispersion chart, but we do not give any other details about use case.

significance of controlling and moderating user input and model output when building applications that use LLMs underneath.\n\n📥 **User input control** refers to the implementation of mechanisms and techniques to monitor, filter, and manage the content provided by users when engaging with powered LLM applications. This control empowers developers to mitigate risks and uphold the integrity, safety, and ethical standards of their applications.\n\n📤 **Output model control** refers to the implementation of measures and methodologies that enable monitoring and filtering of the responses generated by the model in its interactions with users. By exercising control over the model’s outputs, developers can address potential issues such as biased or inappropriate responses.\n\nModels like ChatGPT can exhibit biases or inaccuracies, particularly when influenced by unfiltered user input during conversations. Without proper control measures, the model may inadvertently disseminate misleading or false information. Therefore, it is essential not only to moderate user input, but also to implement measures for moderating the model’s output.\n\nOpenAI provides a Moderation API for that purpose. Specifically, the moderation endpoint serves as a tool for checking content against OpenAI’s usage policies, which target inappropriate categories like hate speech, threats, harassment, self-harm (intent or instructions), sexual content (including minors), and violent content (including graphic details).\n\nLet's start using it to moderate our workflow!\n\nFor more details on the following example, run it along with the article [ChatGPT Moderation API: Input/Output
